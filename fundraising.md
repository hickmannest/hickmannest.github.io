## Direct Donations

We want every Hickman Elementary family to know that we appreciate monetary donations of *any* kind. We know there are some people who can give a lot and others who cannot. Please know that you can ask family, friends, etc. to support by donating using [Square](https://hickman-nest.square.site) or to send in cash/check to the school. Please use the form below. All donations are tax deductible and a tax letter will be issued.

The more we all give, the more the The NEST can give back to the Hickman Elementary community! If you have any questions, please contact the Hickman NEST Treasurer.
 
Thank you for your support! You are making a difference in every student's life at HICKMAN ELEMENTARY!

(Please ask your employer about charitable donation matching. See Corporate Matching List below.)

## Super Pledge Campaign (2022-2023)

Our goal this year is to continue providing art, music, and educational software for all students, AND to support additional budget for safety and student and teacher recognition. You are an important part of the Hickman family and together we can reach our goal. We are introducing our Super Pledge fundraiser to kick off the school year, with a goal of $40,000 for Super Pledge donations. It’s very easy—you make a donation and 100% of your donation goes to Hickman! We also understand the challenges facing our Hickman families right now, and the economic uncertainty for the future. Please make a donation only if you are able to do so. There is absolutely no obligation, and your donation is completely voluntary.
