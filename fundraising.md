Throughout the year the NEST runs a variety of fundraisers to support the educational and enrichment needs of all Hickman Students. We want every Hickman Elementary family to know that we appreciate monetary donations of _any_ kind. We know there are some people who can give a lot and others who cannot.

#### Super Pledge Campaign (2022-2023)

Super Pledge is our largest fundraiser of the school year. We kick it off at the start of the year and make a push to reach our goal by early Fall, however donations are accepted all year long. Families can donate any dollar amount they are able, and Hickman receives 100% of the funds. Corporate matching is offered for this fundraiser.

#### Family Dine-Outs

The NEST partners with local restaurants, presenting an opportunity for raising money through everyday dollars you spend on dining out. Keep an eye on Dojo and Peach Jar for flyers and be sure to share them with family & friends!
