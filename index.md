The Hickman NEST (Nurturing and Encouraging Students Together) is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit supporting the students of Hickman Elementary School (like a PTA). We are a group of volunteers working together to provide valuable educational tools and enriching experiences for all students.

The Hickman NEST is governed by a Board of Directors who are nominated and voted on each Spring. The Board works closely with the school principal and staff to meet the current needs of our students and community.
